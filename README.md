## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of problems aimed generally aimed at users interested in mathematics and computer programming. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that an efficient solution should yield a result on the average computer in less than a minute.

## What is this repository?
This repository contains my attempted solutions for each problem. Time permitting, solutions will be written in Python but may also be attempted in other languages like MATLAB, Rust, or Julia.

Initial solves will represent a "first-thoughts" approach to the problem, and I will strive to iterate on these solutions if I am able in order to try and satisy the one-minute rule.

**NOTE:** Per Project Euler's guidelines, only the first 100 problems will be presented in this repository:

> Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond the first one-hundred problems will have their accounts locked.
