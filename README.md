## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of problems aimed generally aimed at users interested in mathematics and computer programming. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that an efficient solution should yield a result on the average computer in less than a minute.

## What is this repository?
This repository contains my attempted solutions for each problem. Time permitting, solutions will be written in Python but may also be attempted in other languages like MATLAB, Rust, or Julia.

Initial solves will represent a "first-thoughts" approach to the problem, and I will strive to iterate on these solutions if I am able in order to try and satisy the one-minute rule.
